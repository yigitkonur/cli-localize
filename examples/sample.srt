00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
Um, my name is Michael.
Uh, I work here at Y Combinator.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,779
Before that I did two YC startups,
one in 2007 and one in 2012.

3
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:17,280
Today I'm going to be talking to you
about MVP, minimum viable product.

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,296
We always yell at founders
to not use jargon, yet we have

5
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:24,879
all this stupid startup jargon.
And MVP is one of them.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,179
When you think about an MVP,
you should think about something

7
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:28,980
ridiculously simple.

8
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:33,675
This is the first thing you can give
to the very first set of users

9
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:39,429
you want to target in order to see
if you can deliver any value at all to them.

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,439
That's it. Extremely simple.
